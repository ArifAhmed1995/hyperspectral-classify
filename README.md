## Spectral-Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Images Using ICA and Edge-Preserving Filter via an Ensemble Strategy


This python script implements an algorithm detailed in the paper with the above title by Xia et. al.

The details of the paper are in the docstring.  


This particular implementation achieves a average classification accuracy of around 80%. It is inferior to more recent techniques such as Deep Neural Nets(eg. MRA-NET) which achieves above 99% classification accuracy.


Improvements to performance are definitely possible, but given recent solutions to solve the same problem it seems unnecessary. This mini-project was mainly done out of curiosity and to implement an image processing algorithm from scratch.
